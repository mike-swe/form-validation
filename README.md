# Login form validation with a modal
## Hello,
In this project i was just iterating the basic form validation, that pop-ups an alert when the user has entered the required input correctly as per validation, but then i also had another problem to solve which arose from the fact that i didn't like how the alert box looks and i think it sometimes freaks out some non-tech people hence the idea to make a modal that serve the function of an alert box cause i get to design it and make it more aesthetic and less frightening to some people.
